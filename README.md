# Project Overview - http://jsandlund.github.io/udacity-fend-p6-jasmine/

In this project students are given a web-based application that reads RSS feeds. The original developer of this application clearly saw the value in testing, they've already included [Jasmine](http://jasmine.github.io/) and even started writing their first test suite! Students are tasked with completing the test suites.
